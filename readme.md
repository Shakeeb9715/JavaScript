> Things I learned in this project;
  * How to create `canvas` elements in the browser and create animation games.
  * How to generate animations using the `frameRate()` method to display frames every certain number per second.
  * How to `audio.play()` an audio effect in the canvas when event happens.
  * How to use keyboard events when a key is pressed during the animation.
